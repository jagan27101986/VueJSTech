# vuejs-neds

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

As this is my first project in Vue Js, The aim was to create a single page application with Vue Js with the following API to get racing details with countdown timer.
https://api.neds.com.au/rest/v1/racing/?method=nextraces&count=20

After 60 seconds on the start of the race, the race would be removed from the list.
The App has been written in Vue JS.
Quick start Clone or download this repository to your computer. Change into the directory that was just downloaded. To setup the required libraries and initialise the application you must run:
npm install
For running the app in the browser â€“ type the command 
npm run dev
On success, type the url in the browser - localhost:8080
To build and place it in the web server, run the command npm run build
